## [Unreleased]

- Your notes for upcoming changes...

## [1.2.0] - 2024-04-10

### Improved
- Optimized `ensure_nltk_data()` to check the presence of necessary NLTK data before downloading.
- Enhanced error handling in `fetch_page_content` with more specific exceptions for different types of HTTP errors.
- Refined text preprocessing for efficiency using list comprehensions and NLTK's built-in functions for stopwords filtering.
- Improved LSI model creation and topic extraction process by dynamically selecting the number of topics based on content size and optimizing methods for topic extraction.
- Refined the logic for ensuring lists (entities and LSI keywords) have the same length before DataFrame creation, resulting in more efficient and reliable DataFrame instantiation.
- General improvements in code structure and readability, ensuring better adherence to PEP 8 guidelines and organizing the code into more reusable functions.

### Documentation
- Updated README.md and inline comments to reflect code changes and optimizations.

## [1.1.0] - 2024-04-04

### Added
- Progress Reporting to inform users about the current operation, enhancing user experience.
- `ensure_nltk_data()` function for checking and downloading necessary NLTK datasets (`punkt`, `stopwords`, `brown`) if not present.
- User-Agent in HTTP requests for improved compatibility with web servers.

### Improved
- Error handling with try-except blocks around network requests and major operations.
- Code refactoring for better readability, maintainability, and efficiency.
- Text preprocessing to include case-insensitive stopword removal.
- DataFrame creation process in `create_data_frame` function, ensuring lists for entities and LSI keywords have equal lengths before DataFrame instantiation.

### Fixed
- An issue where DataFrame creation could fail due to mismatched lengths of entities and LSI keywords lists.

### Security
- Added headers to HTTP requests to mimic real browser requests, enhancing security and reliability.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-03-01

- Initial release.
